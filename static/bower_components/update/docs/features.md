# Features

Update offers an elegant and robust suite of methods, carefully organized to help you accomplish common activities in less time, including:

* **unparalleled flow control**: through the use of [updaters](https://github.com/update/getting-started), [sub-updaters](https://github.com/update/getting-started) and [tasks](https://github.com/update/getting-started)
* **templates, scaffolds and boilerplates**: update a single file, initialize an entire project, or provide ad-hoc "components" throughout the duration of a project using any combination of [templates, scaffolds and boilerplates](#templates-scaffolds-and-boilerplates)
* **any engine**: use any template engine to render templates, including [handlebars](http://www.handlebarsjs.com/), [lodash](https://lodash.com/), [swig](https://github.com/paularmstrong/swig) and [pug](http://jade-lang.com)
* **prompts**: asks you for data when it can't find what it needs, and it's easy to customize prompts for any data you want
* **data**: gathers data from the user's environment to populate "hints" in user prompts and to use when rendering templates
* **streams**: interact with the file system, with full support for [gulp](http://gulpjs.com) and [assemble](https://github.com/assemble/assemble) plugins
* **smart plugins**: Update is built on [base](https://github.com/node-base/base), so any "smart" plugin can be used
* **stores**: persist configuration settings, global defaults, project-specific defaults, answers to prompts, and so on
